### Playfair Display ###

* **Version**
Version 1.005

* **Description**
Playfair is a transitional design, that is well suited for titling and
headlines. It has an extra large x-height and short descenders. It can be set
with no leading if space is tight, for instance in news headlines, or for
stylistic effect in titles. Capitals are extra short, and only very slightly
heavier than the lower­case characters. This helps achieve a more even
typographical colour when typesetting proper nouns and initialisms.
Languages, like German, where nouns are capitalized, particularly benefit from
this lower contrast between lower and upper case glyphs. In German, with it’s
many capitalized words, and other European languages that use many diacritical
characters, it is advised to use more leading.

Playfair includes a full set of smallcaps, common ligatures, and discretionary
ligatures. For Polish, a set of alternate diacritical characters designed with
‘kreska’s are included. All European lan­guages using the latin script are
supported. A set of eight arrow devices are also included.

Playfair Display also cover the cyrillic glyphs used in Bulgarian, Belarusian,
 Russian, Bosnian/Serbian (including Serbian morphology for б), and Ukrainian.

Playfair Display comes in three weights and two styles, including smallcaps
for all weights and styles - also for the cyrillic.

Playfair Display is published under the SIL Open Font License Version 1.1,
granting you license to use the fonts free of charge, and enables you to
