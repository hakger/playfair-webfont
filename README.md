* **Description**
Play­fair is a trans­itional design, that is well suited for titling and 
head­lines. It has an extra large x-height and short des­cend­ers. It can be set
with no lead­ing if space is tight, for instance in news head­lines, or for
styl­istic effect in titles. Cap­it­als are extra short, and only very slightly
heav­ier than the lower­case char­ac­ters. This helps achieve a more even
typo­graph­ical col­our when type­set­ting proper nouns and ini­tial­isms.
Lan­guages, like Ger­man, where nouns are cap­it­al­ized, par­tic­u­larly bene­fit from
this lower con­trast between lower and upper case glyphs. In Ger­man, with it’s
many cap­it­al­ized words, and other European lan­guages that use many dia­crit­ical
char­ac­ters, it is advised to use more leading.

Play­fair includes a full set of small-caps, com­mon lig­at­ures, and dis­cre­tion­ary
lig­at­ures. For Pol­ish, a set of altern­ate dia­crit­ical char­ac­ters designed with
‘kreska’s are included. All European lan­guages using the latin script are
sup­por­ted. A set of eight arrow devices are also included.

Play­fair Dis­play also cover the cyril­lic glyphs used in Bul­garian, Belarus­ian,
 Rus­sian, Bosnian/Serbian (includ­ing Ser­bian mor­pho­logy for б), and Ukrainian.

Play­fair Dis­play comes in three weights and two styles, includ­ing small-caps
for all weights and styles – also for the cyrillic.

Play­fair Dis­play is pub­lished under the SIL Open Font License Version 1.1, 
grant­ing you license to use the fonts free of charge, and enables you to
